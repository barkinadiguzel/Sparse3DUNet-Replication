# Sparse3DUNet-Replication
Sparse3DUNet-Replication is a research-grade reimplementation of a 3D U-Net architecture for sparse-annotated volumetric segmentation. It reproduces the original network design, weighted softmax loss, and 3D augmentation pipeline, focusing on faithful architectural and methodological replication rather than model training or benchmarking.
